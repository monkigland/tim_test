All things start somewhere.

This tale starts with a young man, holding a sword, breathing heavily, as the three-room hut he had woken up in that morning burned around him.

It did indeed not look like a good day.

Before him stood the object of his current fiery disaster. It was three times as tall as a average man, had a chest that would make the proudest bull cower in shame, and had more legs than was right to be on any kind of living creature of that size and stature.

And it was on fire.

This had happened before, but never to this magnitude.

"Can i really not get any proper sleep?" asked the boy, voice clipped and restraining something from deeper below.

The fiery creature looked at him, and cocked its head to the side. A plume of flame rose from its feet and drifted up it's frame slipping loose from its head, floating as a bubble a few paces before popping into a puff of smoke.

Mercaius shook his head.

Fire elementals had a habit of forming on him. This one seemed to be linked to the emotion of apathy, apparently. It was, however, a strong one. Far stronger than any that had just naturally formed.

Not the biggest he had summoned into being - but those had been acheived through conscious thought, not just random, ambient coalescence.
